# Cosmoteer-Emmy-BBPP
 My personal mod created to allow multiple different steam workshop mods to be accessable within the Build & Battle mode. You are free to edit anything you don't like about it, such as adding or removing mods, however all players must have the EXACT same copy of the mod or else it will crash.

## Required Mods List:
* Chaingun elbow
* General Munitions' Projectile Weapons
* Micromissle Launcher
* Missile Launchyer Variant - Crippler
* Kurim's More Crew Quarters
* Twin Small Thrusters
* Twin linked point defense turret
* Deranged Industries: Advance Missile Launcer
* DIGI Modular Missiles

## Changelog:
v1.3.1 - Auto Charge item added
* Added offical 0.26.1 support.
* Created a new ship part, the Auto Charge. This is simply an explosive charge the AI will detonate once within 450 units (HE missile range) of an enemy.

v1.3.0 - Bucket update & QoL improvements
* Added categories to all modded weapons. Forgot to do this prior, oops.
	* Added a new category for Utility parts.

* Balance
	* Flamer has been knocked up a price tier
	* EMP weapons are now considered Utility for categories
	* Sulfur genators have all been knocked up one tier. The B&B mode is too short for their fuel downside to be a problem.

## Round Balancing
This is the general draft cost I balance around. It's intended for more shorter cash rounds than a few large cash rounds. In the future I plan on adding a lobby config for the mode, but for now this is the policy at when I balance around.
Round: $ gain / $ total

000000 - Basic
	R1: 75k
100000 - Improved
	R2: 50k / 125k 
	R3: 50k / 175k
250000 - Powerful
	R4: 75k / 250k
	R5: 75k / 325k
400000 - Deadly
	R6: 75k / 450k
	R7: 100k / 550k
550000 - Super
	R8+ repeat previous

## Todo List
* Create late game buckets that will include many lower tier guns. This will provide much more building options and hopefully free up some slots.
* Create a lobby setting format for the mode.
